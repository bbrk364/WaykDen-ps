= Database Management

Aside from the Wayk Den configuration files, all Wayk Den data is stored inside a https://www.mongodb.com[MongoDB database]. If you do not specify a database, a simple MongoDB container will be launched with a docker volume attached to it. While this is fine for a lot of use cases, using a single MongoDB container instance is not suitable for high availability scenarios.

== External Database

To point Wayk Den to an existing MongoDB server, you need to configure a database connection string, and set MongoDB as external to avoid launching a MongoDB container instance:

----
PS > Set-WaykDenConfig -MongoExternal $true -MongoUrl 'mongodb://mongo-server:27017'
----

== Database Backup

MongoDB database backups can be done using the https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongodump/[`mongodump` command-line tool]. For simplicity, the `Backup-WaykDenData` command can be used to streamline the process:

----
PS > Backup-WaykDenData -BackupPath .\den-backup.tgz -Verbose
----

The `Backup-WaykDenData` is only usable with a non-external MongoDB database. You can add the `-Verbose` parameter to show the docker commands used to call `mongodump` inside a container for reference.

== Database Restore

A MongoDB database can be restored from a backup using the https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/[`mongorestore` command-line tool]. For obvious reasons, you should be careful about restoring a database, as the operation will overwrite the current data and replace it with the one from the backup.

Just like `Backup-WaykDenData`, `Restore-WaykDenData` should only be used with a non-external MongoDB database. A proper restore involves stopping Wayk Den, restoring data from the backup file, then restarting Wayk Den. Since Stop-WaykDen stops the database container, `Restore-WaykDenData` will automatically start it for the restore operation.

----
PS > Stop-WaykDen
PS > Restore-WaykDenData -BackupPath .\den-backup.tgz -Verbose
PS > Restart-WaykDen
----

== Changing database

It is possible to change databases without deleting the current one, by changing which docker volume is attached to the 'den-mongo' container. The default docker volume name is 'den-mongodata', but you can tell Wayk Den to use a different one:

----
PS > Stop-WaykDen
PS > Set-WaykDenConfig -MongoVolume 'den-testdata'
PS > Start-WaykDen
----

After starting Wayk Den, you should be able to see two docker volumes:

----
docker volume ls
DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
local               den-mongodata
local               den-testdata
----

Since 'den-testdata' is a new empty docker volume, Wayk Den will be the same as a fresh installation. This can be useful for safe experimentation in a temporary database without touching the "good" one.

If you want to revert back to the original database, simply change the docker volume again:

----
PS > Stop-WaykDen
PS > Set-WaykDenConfig -MongoVolume 'den-mongodata'
PS > Start-WaykDen
----

Where 'den-mongodata' is the default docker volume name.

== Deleting database

If you want to start fresh and delete the MongoDB database entirely (use with caution!), here are the steps:

----
PS > Stop-WaykDen
PS > docker rm den-mongo
PS > docker volume rm den-mongodata
----

The above commands stop all containers, delete the 'den-mongo' container currently associated with the 'den-mongodata' volume, and then proceed to delete the docker volume containing the MongoDB database files.
