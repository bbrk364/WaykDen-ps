= Deployment Automation

Once you have a Wayk Den server ready, the next step is to find a way to automate the process of installing, registering and configuring Wayk Now on all of the machines you need to manage. This process is important in order to reduce the total number of manual operations that one needs to perform, especially if you have a large number of machines.

== Installation

Wayk Now should be installed using the .msi installer on Windows, or the .pkg installer on macOS. You cannot use the standalone executable on Windows or the .dmg package on macOS for unattended access, as they are only meant for temporary access. As such, Wayk Now is not an agentless product because you need to install the Wayk Now agent.

If you already have a tool that can push the installer on your machines and install it this way, you can download the packages from our CDN and do the installation this way.

If you do not have a way of pushing the installer on the remote machines but can get them to execute scripts, such as logon scripts pushed through GPO in a Windows domain, we recommend automating the downloading of the package from our CDN.

The downloading and installing of the Wayk Now package is already automated in our https://github.com/devolutions/WaykNow-ps#installuninstall[WaykNow PowerShell cmdlet] available on https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/WaykNow[PSGallery]. This cmdlet is compatible with PowerShell 7 (and Windows PowerShell 5.1) and works on all operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

If you would rather make your own script to do the same thing without using the cmdlet, simply use the PowerShell code available on GitHub as reference to roll your own.

== Enrollment

The enrollment token is used to authorize machines to join your Wayk Den and automatically register for unattended access. This token is meant to be easily embedded within scripts, such that all you need is to run a command to get Wayk Now to register with a specific Wayk Den initially.

To create a new enrollment token, go in "Servers -> Machine Registration", then click the "Generate".

You can set a validity period for the token, or you can also disable token expiration by setting it to 'Never'. If you want to keep using a token after it has expired, there is always the possibility of renewing it.

To simplify group management, you can also select in which group machines using this token will be put. If you want to automatically enroll different machines in different groups, simply create more than one token and use them appropriately.

Click "Generate" to create the enrollment token with the desired options.

You should now see the enrollment token in the list. For the moment, the only information which you need is the token id (f762156f-9470-4dcc-9ba3-157437e465ce), which can be easily embedded in an automation script.

=== Enrollment Using Token Id

After installing Wayk Now on a machine, the 'wayk-now' command-line becomes available for post-installation automation. To automatically enroll Wayk Now to your private Wayk Den, call the 'wayk-now enroll' command with the --token-id and --den-url parameters:

----
wayk-now enroll --token-id f762156f-9470-4dcc-9ba3-157437e465ce --den-url https://den.contoso.com
----

If the command is successful, Wayk Now will be configured to point to your Wayk Den, and will be automatically registered for unattended access. It should now be visible in the list of registered machines in Wayk Den:

=== Enrollment Using Token Data

While the token id is relatively short and easy to embed into a script, it has one disadvantage: it doesn't contain information about the Wayk Den it belongs to. This is why the '--den-url' parameter is required when using the token id for automated enrollment.

The alternative is to extract and use the full token data, such that the only thing you need is the token. However, the token data is usually much longer and usually needs to be embedded in a file to be passed to Wayk Now.

To extract the enrollment token data, click on the vertical ellipsis (&#8942;) button besides the enrollment token, and select "View full token":

The full token data will be presented for you to copy to the clipboard. This long string is a valid JSON Web Token (JWT), and its contents can be inspected by pasting it in the https://jwt.io/[jwt.io debugger tool].

For automated enrollment, save this token to a file on disk (such as 'C:\token.txt') and then use the 'wayk-now enroll' command:

----
wayk-now enroll --token-file C:\token.txt
----

Alternatively, you can also pass the full enrollment token data at the command-line, even if it is quite long:

----
wayk-now enroll --token-data eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2Rlbi5idXp6d29yZC5tYXJrZXRpbmciLCJqdGkiOiJmNzYyMTU2Zi05NDcwLTRkY2MtOWJhMy0xNTc0MzdlNDY1Y2UiLCJpYXQiOjE1OTcwODI3NjMsImV4cCI6MTU5OTY3NDc2M30.hWaKDCHXuCHd6dXNwkvdCVKSY3eZXN7qWKKPkeSFdT4NkhT8H-p_GNXxpXuE-OTfOFislg9F1eacV5p86ef3qukgWp_qw_LJ6O8kBcq1AQccSFM7nkyB5yvXnAFbvuOJyUnGxmGG0eO9b3ihA3RVZdQFaQrn7uDyQSAnPssq1M0tli9ywcXki__IzAFI7ZXDPZPKwEw_xedADNSNfL7Gb_pnFnTsyuSOLynq7T8TPdR0G5YSG6palnRjWKPlZeEfYhYq6qu_zDSDLDLgfLFxjSxVHUGd62cSC3r1ne5Viu7GZKZIQJR2T1ljWPBfttqYjrHZMTe6JiU3-E7VUVYLVQ
----

However, we recommend using a file to pass the enrollment token data whenever possible, as simple copy/paste errors are easy to make with large strings like this.

== Configuration

Once Wayk Now is installed and registered with Wayk Den, you may want to change configuration settings. This can be done through the 'wayk-now config' command, https://helpwayk.devolutions.net/kb_configcommandline.html[documented here].

These commands can be appended to your custom deployment script that installs the package, performs automated enrollment and finishes by modifying the configuration.
